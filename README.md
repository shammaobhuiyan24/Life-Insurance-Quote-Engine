# Life-Insurance-Quote-Engine
This repository contains a functional life insurance pricing and underwriting engine developed in Microsoft Excel. The model is designed to automate the generation of annual premiums for term-life products by mapping user demographics against industry-standard mortality data while accounting for complex medical risk factors.
The engine's core logic is built upon the 2015 VBT (Valuation Basic Table) ALB mortality data provided by the Society of Actuaries. By utilizing dynamic Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and INDIRECT, the system performs real-time data retrieval based on specific user inputs including age, sex, and smoker status. To ensure the model reflects real-world insurance economics, a minimum coverage floor of $100,000 is enforced to account for administrative policy fees and carrier overhead.
A significant feature of this project is the Multiplicative Loading Model used for medical underwriting. Unlike basic additive models, this engine multiplies health factors to accurately capture the synergistic risk of comorbidities, such as the combined impact of Diabetes and Hypertension. Furthermore, the engine includes automated Hard Decline triggers for uninsurable conditions. If a user selects high-risk history such as Congestive Heart Failure or Multiple Strokes, the system immediately overrides premium generation to display a "DECLINED" status.
The project architecture prioritizes a clean, dashboard-style interface by separating back-end actuarial data from the front-end user dashboard. The User Input tab utilizes data validation and conditional formatting to provide immediate visual feedback, turning red for declines and green for valid quotes. To protect the integrity of the underlying math, the background Calculations and Data tabs are hidden, and the front-end sheet is protected to prevent accidental formula modification.
